# Matrix Class Example

In this project we will implement a basic matrix class template
and define some of its operations.

An eventual goal is to use this class as part of the implementation
of a basic, yet fairly general, ODE solver.

The purpose of this project is hands-on learning.

## To Do

- ~~Add vector subclass with subscript operator.~~
- Implement operator\* for ~~scalar (first) and~~ matrix multiplication.
- ~~Move class and method definitions to header.~~
- Use the Matrix class to implement a simple numerical ODE solver.

Further on:

- Make scalar multiplication work for Vector.
- Perhaps we should use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern for Vector.
