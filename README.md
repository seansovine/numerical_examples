# Numerical Example Projects

This repo will contain example projects that I've created while learning
more computational mathematics.

It's intended that the projects here will each help me learn more about
some particular aspect of the math or the software development side of
some problem or technique. As such, the results will most often be far
from what I would want to end up with for production code.

These are just fun exercises and learning tools. Steps along the way.

## `cpp_matrix`

This is the start of a very basic C++ matrix class template library.
Currently implements matrix and vector types with scalar and
matrix-matrix multiplication. Definitely a work-in-progress.

See the project [README](./cpp_matrix/README.md).
