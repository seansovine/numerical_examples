# Numerical Example Projects

This repository will contain example projects that I've created while learning
more computational mathematics. The code in these projects will be more
incomplete and less polished than what I would want in production code.
These are fun exercises and learning tools.

## `cpp_matrix`

This is a basic C++ matrix class template library.
There is an example program that uses the library to compute the steady-state of
a Markov chain. I plan to use it to help implement a differential equation solver.

See the project [README](./cpp_matrix/README.md).
