# Numerical Example Projects

This repository contains example projects that I've created while learning
more computational mathematics. The code in these projects is more
incomplete and less polished than what I would want in production code.
These are fun exercises and learning tools.

## `cpp_matrix`

This is a basic C++ matrix class template library, with some basic examples
of its use. I plan to use this library in code I write for other examples,
so I'll probably keep adding to it as time goes on.

See the project [README](./cpp_matrix/README.md).
