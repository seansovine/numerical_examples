# Numerical Example Projects

This repository contains example projects that I've created while learning
more computational mathematics. These projects are just for the sake of learning,
and the code in them is incomplete and less polished than what I would want for
production code. For real projects, I would use a well-maintained,
professional library when possible.

## `cpp_matrix`

This is a basic C++ matrix class template library, with some basic examples
of its use. I plan to use this library in code I write for other examples,
so I'll probably keep adding to it as time goes on.

See the project [README](./cpp_matrix/README.md).

## `diff_eq`

This folder contains projects for modeling with ordinary and partial differential equations
and computing and visualizing numerical approximations of their solutions.

## `image_proc`

This folder is for image processing projects. Right now it contains a C program I've written to
read a 24-bit BMP-formatted image file, convert its pixels from color to grayscale, and write the converted
image to a new file.
