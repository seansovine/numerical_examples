# Numerical Example Projects

This repository contains example projects that I've created while learning
more computational mathematics. The code in these projects is more
incomplete and less polished than what I would want in production code.
These are fun exercises and learning tools.

## `cpp_matrix`

This is a basic C++ matrix class template library.
There is an example program that uses the library to compute the steady-state of
a Markov chain. I plan to use it to help implement a differential equation solver.

See the project [README](./cpp_matrix/README.md).
