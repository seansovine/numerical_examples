# Numerical Differential Equations

This folder will contain projects for modeling with and numerical approximations of solutions
to differential equations, ordinary and partial.

## `orbital_mech`

This project has a Python script to simulate the Earth's orbit around the Sun,
with various parameters, such as distance from Sun and initial velocity,
tweaked from their realistic values. It produces an animation and saves it to
a gif file, using the matplotlib `FuncAnimation` class.
