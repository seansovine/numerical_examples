# Numerical Differential Equations

Projects for modeling with ordinary and partial differential equations
and computing numerical approximations to their solutions.

## `orbital_mech`

Right now this project has a small Python script that simulates a body orbiting a
much more massive body, using Newton's law of gravitation to approximate Keplerian
orbits. I'd like to add some more simulations from celestial mechanics.
