# Numerical Differential Equations

This folder will contain projects for modeling with ordinary and partial differential equations
and computing and visualizing numerical approximations of their solutions.

## `orbital_mech`

This project has a Python script that simulates the Earth's orbit around the Sun,
with the initial distance from Sun and initial velocity magnitude and direction
changed by small multiples from their realistic values. It produces an animation and saves it to
a gif file.
